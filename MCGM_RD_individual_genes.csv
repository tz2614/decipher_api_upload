FG10 (Family FG IV) G>A44  G15D heterozygous - apparently unaffected father - no past history of decrease in VA Fundus examination and explorations are normal - patient 30 years old.   Absent from 192 control chromosomes.  Taken from paper 'Located in the NH2 cytoplasmic domain of the protein -  p.G15D is predicted to change the polarity and/or the charge of the NH2 terminus of the protein and therefore may be regarded as disease causing'.  Authors note age of onset and the disease progression (stage of the disease and visual function) were highly variable interfamilially and intrafamilially.

Am J Ophthalmol. 129(2): 260-262.   Abstract only   PURPOSE: To report the molecular characterization of a novel VMD2 mutation causing a Best macular dystrophy sporadic case.    METHODS: All family members underwent ophthalmologic examination and genetic testing by single strand conformation polymorphism analysis and direct sequencing of the VMD2 gene.    RESULTS: A single T to G transition at nucleotide 663 was identified in one of the VMD2 gene copies of the patient, which results in a Cys to Trp substitution at position 221 in the corresponding protein (C221W). Sequence analysis of the VMD2 exon 6 of both parents of the patient did not reveal any mutation.    CONCLUSION: These data confirm the involvement of the VMD2 gene in Best macular dystrophy onset, even in sporadic cases of the disease, pointing out the relevance of molecular analysis in the diagnosis of this degenerative retinal disease.

Am J Ophthalmol. 129(2): 260-262.   Abstract only   PURPOSE: To report the molecular characterization of a novel VMD2 mutation causing a Best macular dystrophy sporadic case.    METHODS: All family members underwent ophthalmologic examination and genetic testing by single strand conformation polymorphism analysis and direct sequencing of the VMD2 gene.    RESULTS: A single T to G transition at nucleotide 663 was identified in one of the VMD2 gene copies of the patient, which results in a Cys to Trp substitution at position 221 in the corresponding protein (C221W). Sequence analysis of the VMD2 exon 6 of both parents of the patient did not reveal any mutation.    CONCLUSION: These data confirm the involvement of the VMD2 gene in Best macular dystrophy onset, even in sporadic cases of the disease, pointing out the relevance of molecular analysis in the diagnosis of this degenerative retinal disease.

In vitro functional studies demonstrated that while the protein possessing the R218C variant still localized to the plasma membrane, it failed to increase the Ca2+ dependent anion permeability in transfected cells (Milenkovic et al., 2011). According to the Human Gene Mutation Database (HGMD), many other missense variants (L217F, R218S, R218G, R218H, Q220P) have been reported in this residue and in neighboring residues (Stenson et al., 2014). The R218C was not observed in approximately 6,500 individuals of European and African American ancestry in the NHLBI Exome Sequencing Project, indicating it is not a common benign variant in these populations.
